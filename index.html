<h1 style="text-align: center;">Education System in India</h1>
<hr>
<p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;">The Indian education system is a vast and complex structure primarily managed by government and private institutions at the central, state, and local levels. It has undergone significant reforms, most notably with the introduction of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which aims to make education more holistic, flexible, and <skill-oriented class="br"></skill-oriented> 
Structure of the Education Systembr

The traditional 10+2 system is being replaced by the NEP 2020's 5+3+3+4 curricular structure which is based on the cognitive development stages of children: <br>
Foundational Stage (5 years): Ages 3-8, including 3 years of pre-school/Anganwadi and Classes 1-2. Focuses on play-based learning and foundational literacy/numeracy. <br>
Preparatory Stage (3 years): Ages 8-11, covering Classes 3-5. Shifts to more formal subjects like math, science, and languages. <br>
Middle Stage (3 years): Ages 11-14, covering Classes 6-8. Introduces more specialized subjects and critical thinking skills, with an option for vocational education from Grade 6. <br>
Secondary Stage (4 years): Ages 14-18, covering Classes 9-12. Offers flexibility in subject choices (Science, Commerce, Humanities, or vocational streams) and deeper learning. <br> 
Following the 12th grade, students pursue higher education, including undergraduate (bachelor's degrees typically 3-4 years) and postgraduate programs (master's, PhDs) in universities and specialized institutions. <br>
Key Features and Regulatory Bodies <br>
Right to Education (RTE) Act: Ensures free and compulsory education for all children aged 6 to 14 as a fundamental right.
Medium of Instruction: English is a primary medium of instruction, especially in professional and higher education, alongside Hindi and various regional languages. <br>
Governing Bodies: The system is regulated by national bodies such as the University Grants Commission (UGC) for general university education, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) for engineering and management, and the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for curriculum development. <br>
Diverse Boards: Schools are affiliated with various boards like the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE/ICSE), and individual State Boards, each with its own curriculum. <br>
Focus Shift: There is a current shift from rote learning to conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and skill-based/experiential learning, largely driven by the NEP 2020.</p>
